# GTPB' Training Course Design 
**DRAFT**

This page will serve as a draft to the development of all documentation necessary to share our methods, ideas,  and experience of 30 years of courses program. Our goal is to provide guidelines and instructions to other organizers and instructors, in order to help them to prepare a structured, well-balanced, "measurable" training event.
